* Multiple sets of changes independent of a single "index" mandated by the git design
* Single executable file and no need for installation
* Runs on Windows and Linux (using Mono) and perhaps on other OS-es with Mono support
* Create and manage multiple git repos
* Easy scan for local repos
* Supports multiple remote repos
* Multiple workspaces which are sets of repos
* Add custom tools to context menus to customize it to your specific needs
* Easy manage SSH keys and remotes
* See files' revision history, stash, unstash etc.
* Manage local and remote branches
* Integrated git command line interface if you still want to use it
* Users familiar with Perforce will find this UI very familiar

## Setting up development environment

On Windows OS, install MSVC 2015 (other versions may work as well)
On Linux OS, install Mono.

The current code has been developed on Windows and the same binary works well on Linux (using Mono).
It should also work on other OS-es that have Mono support.
